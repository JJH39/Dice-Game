# Dice-Game
This game was a project on a JS Udemy course.

HTML and CSS was provided so as to focus on JS but there was some manipulation and edits made to the HTML and CSS code throughout the project.

- Players roll dice to increase score.
- Players can hold points at any time.
- Rolling a 1 will lose all un-held points and the other player begins their turn.
- First to 30 points wins the game.
